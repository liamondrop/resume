### PROFILE

I am a passionate, self-motivated and curious engineer with several years experience working as a highly valued partner and mentor to my teammates, designing and implementing technically sophisticated web and mobile applications using JavaScript, Python, C++ and more. I am gaining experience with AI, computer vision and machine learning as they apply to autonomous robotics, both in my studies at Georgia Tech and in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
